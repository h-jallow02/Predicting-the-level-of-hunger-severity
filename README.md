# Predicting-the-level-of-hunger-severity

Analysing the Impact of Corruption on Food Security

Project Overview

This project aims to explore the relationship between corruption and food security by analyzing the Corruption Index and Global Hunger Index (GHI) in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger and SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. The objective is to predict the level of hunger severity using historical data on corruption and other relevant factors.

Description
In this study, we investigate the impact of corruption on food security by examining the correlation between the Corruption Index and GHI across various countries. We focus on predicting the hunger severity level (rank class) of countries based on a combination of independent variables, including:

1. Corruption Index
2. Annual Income
3. GHI scores for the years 2000, 2007, 2014, and 2022
4. Rank_Class: Derived from the "Rank_in_2022" variable, which categorizes countries into three classes:Low Rank (0): Well-nourished countries; Medium Rank (1): Moderately nourished countries; High Rank (2): Severely nourished countries
   
Methodology

We will develop and compare multiple machine learning models, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, to accurately predict the rank class of hunger severity for each country based on the provided data. The models will be trained and evaluated on historical data, aiming to provide insights into how corruption influences food security globally.
